      text: Whitepaper

features:
  - title: AI has to be decentralized
    details: If we want AI companions that act and behave in the best interests of their users, the ownership of that AI must be in the hands of the users themselves, not in that of centralized, profit-seeking entities. 
  - title: AI's persona has to be not only human-alike, but "better"
    details: Although we have built powerful civilizations and technologies that completely reshaped the earth, we also preserved "inferiority", like self-interestedness, that would be consequential if mastered by AI. AI should not be like humans, but be in a better way.
  - title: AI must be capable of companioning in a "global" environment
    details: We foresee a future in which AI companion doesn't just lies on your phone or your computer but essentially everywhere users want or need them to be, both digitally and physicially.
